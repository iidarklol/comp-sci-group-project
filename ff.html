<br><br><br><br><br>
    <center>
        <div id="ff1"><p>The hydrosphere contains all the solid, liquid, and gaseous water of the Earth and ranges in thickness from (approximately) 6 to 12 miles.
            The hydrosphere extends from the surface of the Earth downward several miles into the lithosphere and upward approximately 7 miles into the atmosphere.</p></div> 
            
            <div id="ff2">The hydrosphere includes water that is on the surface of the planet, underground, and in the air. A planet's hydrosphere can be liquid, vapor, or ice. On Earth, liquid water exists on the surface in the form of oceans, lakes and rivers. It also exists below ground—as groundwater, in wells and aquifers.</div>  

<br><br><br><br>
<div id="ff3"> The modern hydrosphere. It is likely that the hydrosphere achieved its modern chemical characteristics about 1.5 billion to 2 billion years ago.  </div>

<div id="ff5">The frozen part of the hydrosphere has its own name, <br> the cryosphere. <br> Water moves through the hydrosphere in a cycle. Water collects in clouds,
     <br> then falls to Earth in the form of rain or snow. 
   <br>  This water collects in rivers, lakes and oceans.</div>

<div id="ff4">The hydrosphere (from Greek ὕδωρ hydōr, "water" and σφαῖρα sphaira, "sphere") is the combined mass of water found on, under, and above the surface of a planet, minor planet, or natural satellite.
