                The Nile flows north for about 6,650 kilometers (4,132 miles), from the African Great Lakes through the Sahara desert before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea. It goes through 11 countries — Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt — and drains 3.3 million square kilometers (1.3 million miles), or about 10% of the African continent.

            After starting its seemingly slow and subtle voyage in the highlands of Peru, the Amazon River traverses through Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela before entering Brazil and flowing out of its Atlantic coast. However, its tributaries also flood the Amazon basin in Bolivia in the south, home to the Madidi National Park (one of the Amazon’s largest protected reserves) as well as Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana. Given each country’s distinctive tourist infrastructure, some spots are simply better and more rewarding to visit than others, depending on whether you’re after a land-based Amazon tour or Amazon River cruise. The most established visiting hot-spots are in Peru (Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado), Ecuador (Coca), Brazil (Manaus) and Bolivia (Rurrenabaque).
            It’s an astonishing percentage when one thinks about it: one-fifth of the fresh water that flows into our earth’s seas flow into the Atlantic at the Amazon River Delta in northern Brazil. This is the largest river delta on our planet (discharging more freshwater than the following seven largest rivers combined) creating a muddy patch of salty-vs-fresh water that covers an area of 2.5 million sq km!

            Ganges River, Hindi Ganga, great river of the plains of the northern Indian subcontinent. Although officially as well as popularly called the Ganga in Hindi and in other Indian languages, internationally it is known by its conventional name, the Ganges. From time immemorial it has been the holy river of Hinduism. For most of its course it is a wide and sluggish stream, flowing through one of the most fertile and densely populated regions in the world. Despite its importance, its length of 1,560 miles (2,510 km) is relatively short compared with the other great rivers of Asia or of the world.

      <div class="modal-body">
        Encompassing over 1.2 million square miles, the Mississippi River is the third-largest river basin in the world. The Mississippi is only out-ranked by the Amazon and Congo river basins. The river basin collects water from 31 states. The Mississippi River watershed covers over 40% of the continental United States.
        The Mississippi River's widest point is where the river forms Lake Winnibigoshish, near Bena Minnesota. At its widest point, the Mississippi's Lake Winnibigoshish is over 11 miles across. Within the river's shipping channel, the widest point is Lake Pepin, where the channel is about 2 miles wide.
